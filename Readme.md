## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for any programmer or software engineer. This repository aims to provide a clear and concise implementation of various data structures and algorithms in the Java programming language. By studying and working with these implementations, you can deepen your understanding of how these fundamental concepts work and can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## Data Structures

Here is a list of data structures that are included in this repository:

- **Arrays:** Basic arrays and dynamic arrays (ArrayList).
- **Linked Lists:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Implementations of stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs:** Basic graph representations and graph algorithms.
- **Hash Tables:** Basic hash table and hash map implementations.

## Algorithms

This repository also contains various algorithms for solving common problems and tasks, such as:
